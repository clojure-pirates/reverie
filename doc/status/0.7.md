# reverie/CMS 0.7

Reverie has finally reached 0.7 status. This release includes a massive rewrite from 0.6.x with a clear separation of the core of the CMS and the database backend that handles the storage.

## Changelog

Too massive to be detailed. Short story:

- Massively increased usage of protocols to describe the flow of things
- Automatic admin interface for modules rewritten
- Fields for objects and modules now share the same code
- Node tree in the admin interface now uses fancyTree instead of dynaTree
- Separated core implementation and SQL implementation
- Factored out a number of libraries from functionality originally written for reverie
- Moved from Clojure 1.6 to 1.8 as minimum version
