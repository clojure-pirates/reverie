# What is a CMS?

## Wikipedia definition

A content management system (CMS) is a computer application that allows publishing, editing, modifying, organizing, deleting, and maintaining content from a central interface. Such systems of content management provide procedures to manage workflow in a collaborative environment. These procedures can be manual steps or an automated cascade. CMSs have been available since the late 1990s.

CMSs are often used to run websites containing blogs, news, and shopping. Many corporate and marketing websites use CMSs. CMSs typically aim to avoid the need for hand coding, but may help it for specific elements or entire pages.

## My definition

A clever ploy instigated by a genius, possibly a group of geniuses, to keep developers in good paying jobs by ensuring ever increasing complexity in the development process.

I jest... but only barely. Truth be told, CMSs are complex beasts by their nature trying to incorporate in a structured and well thought out manner several areas including, but not limited to: Content editing, resource reuse, resource management, publishing, version control, development of custom features, collaboration between many editors, access control, integration with other systems, design, etc...

By their nature they can be amazingly powerful tools, and also an increadible source of frustration as you try to bend them to your will. reverie is taking what I have seen works the best and trying to blend it into a mix that is less painful than many of the alternatives.
