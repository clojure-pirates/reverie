# Why use a CMS? Why can't I use [name here]?

You are of course more than free to use the large number of alternatives there exists to using a CMS. I would argue that the primary use case for a CMS is when you expect other people to be involved in running the website and that they will want to update what's there.

## Frameworks?

For a certain range of products a framework can be a better solution than a full CMS. Any type of web app will in general benefit more from a framework than a CMS. This includes hand built stacks which is quite common in the Clojure community.

Side note: For serious web apps I would strongly urge to take a look at a Clojure/ClojureScript stack for backend/frontend

## I build my own stuff!

Ohkay... tell me how it goes! Would love to know. And if you need a shoulder to cry on in the event it comes crashing down I'm here bro.
