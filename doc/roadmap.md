# Roadmap
Rough roadmap for 2013.

## General
   - Add visual part. Probably use EDN and RPC
   - Look into rights
   - Would like to have a defpage macro
   - Look into options and their effects

   
## Wish list
   - Use logic programming for rights management
   - Being able to add a jar file with everything for a website and
   have the system load it
   - Support for SQL backend
